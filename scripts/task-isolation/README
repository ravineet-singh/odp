Helper scripts to check and set CPU isolation and execution of application in
isolated CPU(s)

isolate-cpu.sh       isolates desired CPUs
isolate-task.sh      uses isolate-cpu.sh to isolate CPUs before running
                     the desired task. It also provides the possibility
                     to trace kernel disturbance on the isolated CPUs.

isolate-cpu.sh checks the kernel configuration and the kernel cmdline to
 determine if one or several CPUs are isolated, i.e. it checks for;
 CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL_ALL=y", and CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_ALL=y" in the kernel config
 and rcu_nocbs,nohz_full in the kernel cmdline.
 If the desired CPU(s) are not inte the above configuration, it warns but continues
 to isolate the CPU(s) as much as possibe. The isolation is accomplished by
 - Redirecting all IRQ's away from desired isolated cores
 - Using cset (cpuset) to move all running processes and kernel threads
   away from desired isolated cores

isolate-task.sh uses isolate-cpu.sh to isolate desired CPU(s). In addition
 it starts the supplied application on isolated CPU(s) and optionally traces
 the isolated CPU(s) for kernel interaction.
